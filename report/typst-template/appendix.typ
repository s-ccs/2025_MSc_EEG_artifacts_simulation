== Use of AI tools

Parts of the code associated with this Master thesis were produced with the assistance of AI tools. Specifically, in the "Visual Studio Code" code editor, the extension "GitHub Copilot" was used, for the purpose of code completion in sections of the file `AbstractContinuousSignal.jl`. 

No AI tools were employed for the production of the written thesis or that of the materials used for the associated presentation.
